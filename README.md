`py-ecpn` is a Python package for the numerical simulation of equal coupling
photonic networks. Currently, the software allows to study the dynamics on
fully connected, and long-range interacting one-dimensional systems. 


### Prerequisites

pyECPN is developed under python3 and requires the functionality of 

* numpy
* scipy

Further, the figure generation scripts included with the examples require the
funcality of

* matplotlib


## Availability of the software

The py-ecpn software package is derived from research software and meant to
work as a (system-)local software tool. There is no need to install it once you
got a local
[clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
of the repository, e.g. via

``$ git clone https://github.com/omelchert/pyECPN``
